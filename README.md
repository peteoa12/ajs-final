# App built using ES6 and functional inheritance

When you land on the home page you are given 4 catagories to choose from. In each of those catagories you can select from a range of types based on each catagory.
The saved items will be stored using local storage and are present on the home screen when the browser refreshes. 
When the items are deleted they are removed from local storage. When the browser refreshes the items are gone.
